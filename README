netrunner card game, all text right now, no separate screens

todo list:

expose card

toolbox et al: a runner can attempt a run, take credits from toolbox,
abort or end the run without using them, and then use them later in their turn for other things

experiental data: if a new ice is installed in upgraded server, it should be +1 str also.
new extraction may be called after every subroutine.

bad publicity
